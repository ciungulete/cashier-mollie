# Subscriptions

## Creating subscriptions

To create a subscription, first retrieve an instance of your billable model, which typically will be an instance of
`App\User`. Once you have retrieved the model instance, you may use the `newSubscription` method to create the model's
subscription:

```php
$user = User::find(1);
// Make sure to configure the 'premium' plan in config/cashier_plans.php
$result = $user->newSubscription('main', 'premium')->create();
```

If the customer already has a valid Mollie mandate, the `$result` will be a `Subscription`.

If the customer has no valid Mollie mandate yet, the `$result` will be a `RedirectToCheckoutResponse`, redirecting the
customer to the Mollie checkout to make the first payment. Once the payment has been received the subscription will
start.

Here's a basic controller example for creating the subscription:

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Laravel\Cashier\SubscriptionBuilder\RedirectToCheckoutResponse;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

class CreateSubscriptionController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * @param string $plan
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\RedirectResponse
     */
    public function __invoke(string $plan)
    {
        $user = Auth::user();

        $name = ucfirst($plan) . ' membership';

        if(!$user->subscribed($name, $plan)) {

            $result = $user->newSubscription($name, $plan)->create();

            if(is_a($result, RedirectToCheckoutResponse::class)) {
                return $result; // Redirect to Mollie checkout
            }

            return back()->with('status', 'Welcome to the ' . $plan . ' plan');
        }

        return back()->with('status', 'You are already on the ' . $plan . ' plan');
    }
}
```

In order to always enforce a redirect to the Mollie checkout page, use the `newSubscriptionViaMollieCheckout` method
instead of `newSubscription`:
```php
$redirect = $user->newSubscriptionViaMollieCheckout('main', 'premium')->create(); // make sure to configure the 'premium' plan in config/cashier.php
```

### Coupons

Coupon handling in Cashier Mollie is designed with full flexibility in mind.

Coupons can be defined in `config/cashier_coupons.php`.

You can provide your own coupon handler by extending
`\Cashier\Discount\BaseCouponHandler`.

Out of the box, a basic `FixedDiscountHandler` is provided.

### Redeeming a coupon for an existing subscription

For redeeming a coupon for an existing subscription, use the `redeemCoupon()` method on the billable trait:
```php
$user->redeemCoupon('your-coupon-code');
```

This will validate the coupon code and redeem it. The coupon will be applied to the upcoming Order.

Optionally, specify the subscription it should be applied to:
```php
$user->redeemCoupon('your-coupon-code', 'main');
```
By default all other active redeemed coupons for the subscription will be revoked. You can prevent this by setting the
`$revokeOtherCoupons` flag to false:
```php
$user->redeemCoupon('your-coupon-code', 'main', false);
```
## Checking subscription status

Once a user is subscribed to your application, you may easily check their subscription status using a variety of convenient methods. First, the `subscribed` method returns `true` if the user has an active subscription, even if the subscription is currently within its trial period:

```php
if ($user->subscribed('main')) {
    //
}
```

The `subscribed` method also makes a great candidate for a [route middleware](https://www.laravel.com/docs/middleware), allowing you to filter access to routes and controllers based on the user's subscription status:

```php
public function handle($request, Closure $next)
{
    if ($request->user() && ! $request->user()->subscribed('main')) {
        // This user is not a paying customer...
        return redirect('billing');
    }

    return $next($request);
}
```

If you would like to determine if a user is still within their trial period, you may use the `onTrial` method. This method can be useful for displaying a warning to the user that they are still on their trial period:

```php
if ($user->subscription('main')->onTrial()) {
    //
}
```

The `subscribedToPlan` method may be used to determine if the user is subscribed to a given plan based on a configured plan. In this example, we will determine if the user's `main` subscription is actively subscribed to the `monthly` plan:

```php
if ($user->subscribedToPlan('monthly', 'main')) {
    //
}
```

## Cancelled Subscription Status

To determine if the user was once an active subscriber, but has cancelled their subscription, you may use the `cancelled` method:

```php
if ($user->subscription('main')->cancelled()) {
    //
}
```

You may also determine if a user has cancelled their subscription, but are still on their "grace period" until the subscription fully expires. For example, if a user cancels a subscription on March 5th that was originally scheduled to expire on March 10th, the user is on their "grace period" until March 10th. Note that the `subscribed` method still returns `true` during this time:

```php
if ($user->subscription('main')->onGracePeriod()) {
    //
}
```

## Changing Plans

After a user is subscribed to your application, they may occasionally want to change to a new subscription plan. To swap a user to a new subscription, pass the plan's identifier to the `swap` or `swapNextCycle` method:

```php
$user = App\User::find(1);

// Swap right now
$user->subscription('main')->swap('other-plan-id');

// Swap once the current cycle has completed
$user->subscription('main')->swapNextCycle('other-plan-id');
```

If the user is on trial, the trial period will be maintained. Also, if a "quantity" exists for the subscription, that quantity will also be maintained.

## Subscription Quantity

Sometimes subscriptions are affected by "quantity". For example, your application might charge â‚¬10 per month **per user** on an account. To easily increment or decrement your subscription quantity, use the `incrementQuantity` and `decrementQuantity` methods:

```php
$user = User::find(1);

$user->subscription('main')->incrementQuantity();

// Add five to the subscription's current quantity...
$user->subscription('main')->incrementQuantity(5);

$user->subscription('main')->decrementQuantity();

// Subtract five to the subscription's current quantity...
$user->subscription('main')->decrementQuantity(5);
```

Alternatively, you may set a specific quantity using the `updateQuantity` method:

```php
$user->subscription('main')->updateQuantity(10);
```

## Subscription Taxes

To specify the tax percentage a user pays on a subscription, implement the `taxPercentage` method on your billable model, and return a numeric value between 0 and 100, with no more than 2 decimal places.

```php
public function taxPercentage() {
    return 20;
}
```

The `taxPercentage` method enables you to apply a tax rate on a model-by-model basis, which may be helpful for a user base that spans multiple countries and tax rates.

### Syncing Tax Percentages

When changing the hard-coded value returned by the `taxPercentage` method, the tax settings on any existing subscriptions for the user will remain the same. If you wish to update the tax value for existing subscriptions with the returned `taxPercentage` value, you should call the `syncTaxPercentage` method on the user's subscription instance:

```php
$user->subscription('main')->syncTaxPercentage();
```

## Subscription Anchor Date

Not (yet) implemented, but you could make this work by scheduling `Cashier::run()` to only execute on a specific day of the month.

## Cancelling Subscriptions

To cancel a subscription, call the `cancel` method on the user's subscription:

```php
$user->subscription('main')->cancel();
```
or
```php
$user->subscription('main')->cancelAt(now());
```

When a subscription is cancelled, Cashier will automatically set the `ends_at` column in your database. This column is used to know when the `subscribed` method should begin returning `false`. For example, if a customer cancels a subscription on March 1st, but the subscription was not scheduled to end until March 5th, the `subscribed` method will continue to return `true` until March 5th.

You may determine if a user has cancelled their subscription but are still on their "grace period" using the `onGracePeriod` method:

```php
if ($user->subscription('main')->onGracePeriod()) {
    //
}
```

## Resuming Subscriptions

If a user has cancelled their subscription and you wish to resume it, use the `resume` method. The user **must** still be on their grace period in order to resume a subscription:

    $user->subscription('main')->resume();

If the user cancels a subscription and then resumes that subscription before the subscription has fully expired, they will not be billed immediately. Instead, their subscription will be re-activated, and they will be billed on the original billing cycle.
